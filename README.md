# Frequently Asked Questions
**Who can utilize this software?**

The software was designed for users (event coordinators/sponsors) in the Center for Information Technology at Deep Run High School.


**What incited the development of the software?**

Every year, the C.I.T. plans to hold a shadowing event, in which accepted 8th grade students may come to the school and experience a typical day, similar to what they would receive their 9th grade year. In this event, each 8th grade student will be paired with another 8th grade student and one center-student mentor; this combination is denoted as a “pod,” and the software allows the coordinator to create pods based on his/her matching criteria. Each pod is also assigned a schedule (hence, “scheduler”), and the groups will travel to their respective classes based on their schedule.


**How can I use the software?**

Through these documented instructions, you will be able to understand how to utilize the program as well as the functionality of the software. Certain functions, such as priority organization, are more abstract and will be explained in the manual.


**Do I Need to Change any Code or Software?**

No: changes can be made without the modification of code.


**In basic terms, how does the software work?**

The software allows an event sponsor to generate Google Forms based his/her specific criteria. The sponsor will generate two types of Forms: mentor Forms and eighth-grade Forms. Based on the responses of the respective individuals from the forms, the software will generate schedules that match the sponsor’s criteria.
